hello world - DONE
test build system and libraries

4-bit adder
5 bit result, addition

4-bit register
should be able to clock in/out a value.
should be able to enable/disable

finite state machine
traffic light controller, model a real intersection

display decoder
7 seg hex decoder, 8 bit

clock divider
lowers a clock frequency

simple counter
4 bit counter then reset

comparator
two 4 bit numbers, LT, GT, ET, OT

multiplier
two 4 bit numbers to make 8 bit result

4-bit ALU
combine the comparator, multiplier and adder
to make a reasonbaly functional ALU.
should have 4 bit instruction and two 4 bit inputs.
